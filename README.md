# UROP_Homeomorphisms_of_the_circle

This repo contains the outcome of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programme (UROP) of Imperial College London. I was part of this programme in the summer of 2018. 

The project is an analysis of homeomorphisms of the circle which is one of the fundamental topics of a rigorous treatment of Dynamical Systems. 

The first part of the project is an introduction and review of already known results (Poincar√©'s Theorem). The second part of the project contains some new ideas about classification of nontransitive homeomorphisms.

We did not try to publish the results in the end.
